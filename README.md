# Introduction

I've created this repo to share my code with the community: [DataTable.js](https://datatables.net/)

In the repo, you can find classes to implement DataTable.js to your Django app. 

I've created [DataTableFactory](./dtfactory/utilities/dtfactory.py) class to get appropriate DataTableFactory.

You can find an example DataTableFactory by exploring [AWSDataTableFactory](./dtfactory/utilities/factories/aws_dtfactory.py) class.

Also, [DataTableView](./dtfactory/views.py) class is implementing DataTableFactory class.


Hopefully, it helps you.
